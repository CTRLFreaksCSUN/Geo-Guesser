# GeoVision AI
An AI meant to return the original location that an image was taken at.

## Purpose
This artificial intelligence aims to help tourists identify specific locations to travel to based on captivating images of landmarks, topography, ecosystems and other geographical features using a precise global navigation system. It can also be of support to archaeologists and historians, since it can pinpoint a location from analyzing a snapshot of a distinguishable artifact, structure, or even symbols on a wall.
