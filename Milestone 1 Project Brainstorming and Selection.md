What We Are Creating:

An AI-generated desktop program that will scan an image of a building, artifact, landscape or other objects and return the name of the place (town, city, district, country, etc..) itâ€™s from. This program will search for matching photos within an internal database containing the object through an object detection algorithm. Once the location is found, the program will send the user to Google Maps and either show the area in map view or person view depending on what the user chooses.
